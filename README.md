CS230 Operating Platforms
Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

A puzzle competition game was released on the Android platform by The Gaming Room, a successful mobile app game developer. To make the game available across other platforms and devices, the client wanted to create a web-based version of its existing Android app.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I created a thorough section of recommendations outlining important factors the client should take into account, such as the host operating system (OS), memory and storage management programs on host servers, the API framework, security, and the advantages of utilizing serverless architecture to introduce the product. I presented a compelling argument for why a cloud platform was the best option for the customer and their objective.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

In order to comprehend the structure of the relationships between entities representing the app components, it was helpful to analyze the domain model represented as a UML class diagram. This made it easier to create short classes with clear methods that directly benefited from other things to create a clean prototype.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

With a deeper look into the differences between the platforms on the client side, the evaluation part that compares and contrasts popular OSs (such as Mac, Windows, and Linux) and mobile platforms might be strengthened. As the primary engine powering the client's app, the web browser is the main client-side issue. There is little understanding of the differences across OSs for web-based solutions. To determine whether non-favored browsers impose technical or performance limitations, it may be necessary to assess OS preference for specific browsers (e.g., Windows' preference for Edge, Mac's preference for Safari, etc.).


How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

When creating web-based applications, users should prioritize speed and intuitiveness (i.e. usability). Although less significant in comparison to speed and usability are quality features (i.e., the way something looks and feels). If a consumer doesn't like the way the app looks, they might still use it, but if the functionality is unclear or slow, they will stop using the site. The needs of the user are the most important factor because they are the client's main source of income as the product's consumer.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

When creating software, begin broadly and narrowly. To create the ultimate answer, start with top level goals and refine them over various iterations. For instance, the business goals of a client might be divided into functional specifications that list the essential features required to achieve those goals. Technological requirements, which describe the technical strategy for functional fulfillment, can be further subdivided into functional requirements. Technical specifications can then be converted into design blueprints, architectural designs, and programming code to provide the desired outcome.
